      "message": "Hmm, what does this fix exactly? mod_node_page_state ultimately maps to a couple of atomic adds. I\u0027m not seeing why that needs to be done while holding the mutex. The unlock in dmabuf_page_pool_remove looks like it comes after mod_node_page_state to avoid unlocking inside the if block.",

      "message": "Hrm. Yea, your description seems to match my recollection (the pool lock protects the pool data, not the page state).\n\nBut I\u0027m guessing the issue is should the dmabuf_page_pool_remove() path preempt dmabuf_page_pool_add() right after the unlock, you could end up with negative stats for a moment, so serializing the stats here would avoid that.",

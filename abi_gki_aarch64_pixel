# ABI monitoring is not enabled on this branch and this list is not maintained,
# but only here so that one can run:
#
#     bazel run --config=fast \
#         //private/google-modules/soc/gs:slider_abi_update_symbol_list
#
# without having to create this file. That's useful to quickly check which
# symbols are used by the vendor modules.
